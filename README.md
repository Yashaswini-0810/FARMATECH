# FARMATECH
ABSTRACT
Agriculture plays a vital role in the global economy, and the integration of technology in this sector can enhance productivity and efficiency. This project focuses on developing a Farmer and Customer Dashboard along with a Marketplace and Fertilizer Guide, providing a digital platform that connects farmers and customers. The system also includes a Payment Module for secure transactions. The goal is to create an easy-to-use, interactive, and visually appealing web application that facilitates communication and trade between farmers and consumers while promoting sustainable agricultural practices.
PROBLEM STATEMENT
Farmers often face challenges in accessing real-time information, finding reliable dealers, and selling their products efficiently. Traditional methods of trading involve middlemen, leading to unfair pricing and delays. Additionally, the lack of knowledge about proper fertilizers and best farming practices affects crop yield.This project aims to bridge the gap between farmers, and Customers by offering a centralized digital platform that enables:
Farmers to connect with customers, access marketplace services, and get fertilizer recommendations and customerâ€™s feedback.
Customers to buy the products and directly from farmers.
Secure online payments to facilitate smooth transactions directly to the farmer.

PROJECT IDEA
The system consists of the following key modules:
Farmer Dashboard: Allows farmers to access the marketplace, fertilizer guide, and manage transactions.
Customer Dashboard: Enables customers to buy their products and interact with farmers.
Marketplace: A digital space where farmers can sell their crops.
Fertilizer Guide: Provides recommendations based on soil type, crop selection, and best practices.
Payment System: Secure payment gateway integration for transactions between farmers and customers.
This project is designed to improve agricultural trade efficiency, ensure fair pricing, and encourage smart farming practices using digital solutions.
